#+title: Useless Objects

* About

This project is a collection of object specifications.

The objects are useless in the sense that there likely isn't a program
that would benefit from employing them. The effort of creating and
specifying them on the other end should be perfectly useful[fn:1].

* Objects

Each object should be /confounding/ and introduce /counterinuitive/
effects.

Each object is contextualized, summarized and specified. In the
future, example implementations for various languages will be added to
further elucidate intricacies.
